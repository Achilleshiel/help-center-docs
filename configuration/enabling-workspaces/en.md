# Enabling Workspaces

Each of the supported desktop environments in Solus provide support for workspaces, however they are not immediately visible.

## Budgie

You can enable workspaces in Budgie by adding the Workspace Switcher applet to Raven.

Open Raven using the shortcut `Windows Key + A` or use your mouse to open Raven in the far right of the main Budgie panel.

Click the Raven settings 'cog' icon {{< altimg "raven-settings-cog.jpg" "help-center/configuration/enabling-workspaces/" >}}

Click the Panel button.

In the Applets section, click the '+' button.

Find the Workspace Switcher entry and select it.

Click the '+' button at the top of the panel. This will add the applet to the
center section, as shown below.

### Workspaces Configuration

There are 4 workspaces available in Budgie by default. If you would like to change this, you will need to install the
GNOME Tweak Tool, available in the Software Center.

Once installed, open Tweak Tool and click on the Workspaces entry in the main panel to change the number of available
workspaces.
