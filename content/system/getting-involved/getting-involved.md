## Getting Involved

### Google+ and Forums

With so many new users joining, there are always more people needing help. A great way to help us out, would be to help out our users on the [Solus Project Forums](https://solus-project.com/forums/) as well as [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104830131595272878110).

### IRC

Internet Relay Chat is a great way to discuss issues and development with the community, and project developers. It's also a great place for getting support.
