In this window, you can set if you want your primary button (usually left click) to be left or right, speed of double-clicking, and individual pointer speeds for mouse and touchpad.

You can also toggle Tap to click (click via touchpad), two-finger scrolling, and “natural scrolling” (reversed scrolling directions).

You can also test your settings by clicking the Test Your Settings button in the top right of the window.
